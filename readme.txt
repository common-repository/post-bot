Once plugin is installed admin should select a user roles who can able to create a posts using this post bot. So who ever has role selected from admin can able to create the post. Once user provides post information and if the user have role selected then that post is created and published else not. Below are roles which admin can allow by checking multiple roles to allow them to create a post.
Roles:
	* Administrator
	* Subscriber
	* Contributor
	* Author
	* Editor
For ex. Admin have selected roles administrator and contributor. So now user with role administrator or contributor then role with that user can only been able to create post using post bot. The use who have role different than the selected role then they don't see a button Post using bot at front side. So they are not able to create a post.
